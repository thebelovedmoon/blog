    <h1 style="text-align: center;">the first-ever cosplay experience in Pampanga!!</h1>
    <br>
    <p>
      never in my years I would dream that I'd go BEYOND Bataan for my routine
      cosplays. today is the first time that I get to experience an inter-provincial
      experience, courtesy of Vista Mall Pampanga through #MalCon2024 Pampanga Leg
      Day 2!!
    </p>
    <h2>Malolos Convention 2024: Pampanga Leg</h2>
    <p>
      as the title suggests, this is the "Round 2" of the MalCon Series to which I'm
      involved in!! somehow, this brings back memories because the first time I went
      to MalCon for this series was back at Bataan for their own leg -- which I
      attended for a day and half (I went to D2 at 5pm PHT, then somewhat fully on
      D3). in addition, since my line of professional work is around Pampanga, I
      thought I could use that as the next base for my cosplay ops going forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      now you may be asking: why Pampanga, and why don't you go back to Bataan for
      cosplays? primary reason is that I'll return to Bataan every two weeks (unless
      it's urgent business), and primary locations (more specifically malls) were
      easily accessible through public transport since they run on a single route
      for most cases. one primary example is that I toured around Laus Group (the
      headquarters of CLTV36) one night after work. I usually see the building
      whenever I pass by it on my way to Metro Manila and back, so seeing it up
      close feels like a dream come true!!

    <h2>changes made since the last con</h2>
    <p>
      in a nutshell, nothing much; except a few things: updated placard,
      introduction of ID cards, and an invitation to the mix -- among other things!!
      let's take a look at some of these:
    </p>

    </p>
    <h3>updated placard</h3>
    <p>
      for some reason, I was about to reuse the old placard which I first debuted
      during MalCon 2024 Bataan Leg, but then this happend.
    </p>

    <p>
      in a nutshell, I was about to open <code>vtm_widescreen.psd</code> cuz I need
      to update a few things, but the external HDD where it was located decided to
      disconnect on its own and it errored out along with Photoshop. when I tried to
      reopen the file, it was corrupted -- prompting me to restart. surprise,
      surprise; the file has inevitably ceased from existence, and the tempfiles
      didn't help even a single bit.
    </p>
    <p>
      despite the disappointment, however, I was able to recreate the placard;
      however, everything else is lost to time. I could reiterate the lost ones
      through images when they were submitted, however, they may take some time.
    </p>
    <p>
      in any case, it got a lil update following the recreation!! check out the
      graphic below:
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      immediately as I summon the placard, some people turned their heads -- with
      the most being MalCon organizers; with the emcee acknowledging my presence
      back in Bataan!! I guess we've come full circle again after like the last time
      uhuhu
    </p>
    <p>

      &mdash; <cite>cred. Berlyndg for MalCon 2024</cite>
    </p>
    <p>
      before I depart from the event, I immediately had to make it extra special by
      SIGNING the placard -- smth that also happend during the
      <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="20240922" target="_blank"
        >Gakuen-Sai Special</a
      >, but unfortunately it got lost in transit on the way home. I felt kinda
      devastated cuz it had been with me when I disembark on multiple PUJs, but I
      still have an ace up my sleeve: I'll be reprinting them again for the sake of
      archiving, but lacking the autograph. (luckily the autographs were saved on
      different cos cards that I've purchased. we'll discuss regarding that later.)
    </p>
    <h3>A5 prints and ID cards</h3>
    <p>
      you may have noticed that whilst the A5 prints stayed the same, the minicards
      (last featured on the Gakuen-Sai Special) were shrunk to ID cards!! the main
      reason behind it is that it allows me to have more space for the other cards
      to be printed alongside, reducing the printing load any printer will take. in
      addition, since they are going to be cut when it's all done, we have an option
      to cut them all at once!!
    </p>
    <p>
      and of course, the paper that was used for these also have changed: whilst
      photo paper is what I used since I first introduced them during the Bataan
      Leg, I realized that it may not be practical in the long run due to the nature
      of which prints were maintained on paper. so with the Pampanga Leg, I opted
      for a watermarked laid paper; which significantly helped as it also means that
      whatever prints made will be sure that it stays there -- tho I might need some
      time before I can draw a conclusion to that sort.
    </p>
    <p>
      since we're still on the topic of cards, atleast for the ID cards,
      autographing them is a lil difficult cuz you need to leave a space for the
      autograph. so I decided that ID cards will be autographed from behind. A5
      prints is as-is as with the previous cons.
    </p>
    <h3>invitations</h3>
    <p>
      it'll be ways off until the first-ever major event "Inauguration of the
      CosMarias" takes place, but it's better to be ready than not!! as part of the
      word-of-mouth approach, I've decided to craft a design that will fit the
      invitational, welcoming everyone to the party!!
    </p>
    <p>
      later on in the article, we'll be discussing what will be the details of the
      event; alongside who will be attending the event, and which area of the venue
      will be used to accommodate the said event.
    </p>
    <h2>new cos moot: Kura-chii</h2>
    <p>
      it feels like whenever I attend cons I end up making a new fwen, and this
      event is no exception!! while it's unfortunate to see that other CosMarias
      won't make it due to circumstances, it's all worth it in the end!!
    </p>
    <p>
      main reason being that I get to see other guest cosers trying to hype up the
      crowd with the best of their abilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      now let's get to the gist of what's behind meeting our new cos moot: Gravity
      Baruelo or gravityshin -- AKA Kura-chii!!
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="assets/cosplaystuff/20241022/e2f69b68eb60b23a0ac5a441c75ed5ce.jpg" alt="">
      &mdash; <cite>a quick selfie after she had signed the cards!! (I bought em hehehe)</cite>
    </p>
    <p>
      I met her as I was wandering around the venue to see if other CosMarias would
      make it to the event; and at first glance, she looks quite interesting!! had a
      chat with her for a bit before I decided to buy two of her A5 prints~
    </p>
    <p>
      and, just like Shi-Shi, I decided to show her what I've been doing as of late
      when I returned to her booth!! surprisingly, she also shared me some of her
      works -- including the ongoing novel that she's trying to complete!! you can
      check out the following book below:
    </p>
    <p>
      <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://wattpad.com/story/276534484" target="_blank" title='read "The Larson&apos;s: Huxley Winterbourne" on Wattpad'>
        <img src="https://img.wattpad.com/cover/276534484-352-k83799.jpg" alt="">
      </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      and oh, I also gave her some of my prints as souvenirs just incase she needs
      any remembrance, signed on the spot!! somehow she decided to do the same for
      my bought cards, even went as far as giving me one of her minicards as a
      freebie!!
    </p>
    <p>
      to top it all off, I gave her one of the invitations that we'll be discussing
      later. as a result, we took a selfie with our exchanged cards as you saw on
      the first few lines of this section~
    </p>
    <p>
      also, she admitted during our lengthy conversation that she's a lil sick when
      she arrived; which broke my heart for a bit. in the end, we ended our meetup
      with hugs!! before I departed from the venue, I had to bid goodbye to her for
      one last time before heading home uhuhu
    </p>
    <p>
      you can check out her Facebook for updates and her upcoming ventures, linked
      below:

    <h2>some hauls</h2>
    <p>
      <img src="assets/cosplaystuff/20241022/5fa032ea34da0165af9b5fcde426ca93.jpg" alt="">
      &mdash; <cite>finally bought some of these hauls for the first time ever~</cite>
    </p>
    <p>
      before we can proceed further, I finally took some time to look at the items
      and buy ones that are interesting!! coincidentally, Kura's cards were one of
      those!!
    </p>
    <p>in addition, some of her accomplices (I'm assuming) gave me some items!!</p>
    <p>
      for the full disclosure, here are the items which I have received during the
      event:
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>NaruHina large print, where it changes at certain angles (pretty cool :O)</li>
        <li>Kura's A5 prints, along with her minicard</li>
        <li>Reg's business card(?), but hey, it worksüôå</li>
        <li>some bead, used as phone ornaments</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>new cos visual!!</h2>
    <p>
      I'm suuuuuper grateful for another photoshoot opportunity, so I'm excited to
      present this new cos visual, courtesy of Reg Saniano Photography!!
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="assets/cosplaystuff/20241022/33fedbc619eea5ed296c3676ccea4c97.jpg" alt="">
      &mdash; <cite>the new cos visual!! this might be one of my BEST visuals yet ehehe</cite>
    </p>
    <p><i>
      moving forward (atleast until end of 2024), pfps across socials will adhere to
      the new visual!! extra-personal accounts still adheres to the default pfp.
    </i></p>
    <p>
      aaaaaaand to make it EVEN MORE special, I've also added in other visuals since
      I did several poses:
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      coincidentally, he was also the one who did the shoots back at the Gakuen-Sai
      Special -- more specifically for our Sixth CosMaria, Shuui!!
    </p>
    <p>

      &mdash; <cite>Shuui (the Sixth CosMaria) as Harley Quinn!!</cite>
    </p>
    <h3>so um, a funny story..</h3>
    <p>
      while I was thinking which poses I would go with next, I immediately eye at
      Kura-chii thinking that we might do a shoot together; but I was either kinda
      shy or that I might need to provide other alternatives to make a pose, that I
      haven't coordinated with her about it-
    </p>
    <p>
      I mean, I technically would, but I would think she was thinking the same as
      me.. shyness prolly took over??
    </p>
    <p>
      either way, I might hit her up again the next time I got immersed into
      photoshoots :D
    </p>
    <p>
      in addition, I also sent Reg the invitation (discussed later in this blog)
      just incase we need a photographer to curate the event!!
    </p>
    <h2>before heading to the venue..</h2>
    <p>
      I somehow took the plunge to change to my cosplay clothing (cuz I have my bag
      with me) at SM City Pampanga, so technically my first cosplay in the province
      happend there. either way, that gave me an opportunity to canvas potential
      cosplayable dresses!! when I finally finished dressing up, mall-goers began to
      speculate and look at my direction as I head towards the venue; but that's for
      another story.
    </p>
    <p>also, I took a selfie while I was there:</p>

      after quite some words and photos that showcases this con, let's now talk
      about the invitation and how it would affect future cons leading up to

      in short, nuthin much -- during cons that I'll be attending (starting from
      this one), I'll be handing out a letter that correlates to the aforementioned
      event. while I can't share the details (yet) about the content of the print,
      cosers and guests who have received the print may have the chance to attend
      the venue for the upcoming event~
    </p>
    <p>for more details, click the button below:</p>

      <button onclick="window.open('https://bit.ly/CosMariaIncept', '_blank');">the event</button>
    </p>
    <h2>want those photo resources?</h2>
    <p>
      are you curious about more content other than the one mentioned here?? look no
      further -- I've compiled all of em (including past cosplays I did) in a
      unified G Drive folder!! each cosplays are grouped into folders named in
      YYYYMMDD dateformat -- with the first attempt (and my debut as a cosplayer)
      being 20231230!!
    </p>
    <p>you can check em out by clicking the button below:</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
      <button onclick="window.open('https://bit.ly/AgaCosplay', '_blank');">#AgaCosplay, compiled on Google Drive</button>
    </p>
    <h3>can I use these resources?</h3>
    <p>
      absolutely!! you're all set to check out some of the photos I've taken and the
      cosplays I did -- granted that you'll be using them with intent of goodwill.
      everyone deserves to treat each other with positivity, and it's the First
      MariaüçÉ's job to ensure that it stays that way!!
    </p>
    <p>
      anyway, be sure to credit me aswell if you're planning on using em!! you can
      use the following included in the below blockquote:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        photo taken for/by Aga, the incumbent First CosMaria<br>
        check out her other ventures at https://bit.ly/AgaCosplay
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      if you're also planning on posting my cosplays, use the hashtag
      <b>#AgaCosplay</b> on your socials so that I can check it out in my spare
      time!! you can also send me the URL to your post assuming you posted em on my
      email at <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="mailto:jelsa14018@gmail.com">jelsa14018@gmail.com</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>TL;DR</h2>
    <p>
      went through the article but still didn&#39;t understand anything? here&#39;s
      a quick summary to get you up to speed:
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>technically the first is at SM City Pampanga, but the first PROPER is here</li>
        <li>rekindled with the organizers again after the last stunt back at Bataan Leg</li>
        <li>new cos moot: Kura-chii!!</li>
        <li>finally bought some hauls~</li>
        <li>new cos visual!!</li>
        <li>sent some cards for the upcoming event~</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      this took a while to compile as I need some more photos to accompany the
      event; and by the time I had em, I still encounter some hurdles cuz of work
      and stuff. either way, it's nice to see that we're making a mark in the
      cosplay community regardless of conventions~
    </p>
    <p>
      I still have some more opportunities I can't let pass, so I'll still be
      around!! for more updates regarding my ventures, go to X or Facebook at
