    <h1 style="text-align: center;">touring the municipality as a coser!!</h1>
    <br>
    <p>
      this is my first attempt at touring the municipality since the days of
      #AgaCosplay Invades where I visit random places (often the most notable ones)
      outside of conventions, so it has been an awesome experience!! I had a lot of
      fun chatting with fellow cosers who accompanied me throughout this journey,
      therefore I&#39;m sharing these experiences for those who missed my presence
      or is interested in my next few ventures~
    </p>

    <h2>how it all went down</h2>
    <p>

      &mdash; <cite>routemap for the Limay Leg as of 24 Aug 2024</cite>
    </p>
    <p>
      I&#39;ve begun planning this idea right after MalCon 2024 Bataan Leg as
      I&#39;ve been fully invested in my venture into the cosplay space, all thanks
      to my cos moots and the incumbent CosMarias who opened my eyes to its
      extravagance!!
    </p>
    <p>
      anyhow, I was thinking which province should I tour first to kick things off;
      but seeing that Bataan has been with me even way back before I moved to Italia
      on the second half of 2019 and that I&#39;ve been into some of its notable
      places (aside from the fact that it&#39;s closer to home), made me realize
      that I have to make this as a starting point.
    </p>
    <p>
      there&#39;s a lil difference, however, unlike all the previous announces I did
      over the years as a vtuber: since most cosers I personally encounter with
      doesn&#39;t have X (Twitter), I posted updates on Facebook instead; and
      somehow I made it specificlally for cos-related contexts (altho I might strem
      on there or post more vtuber updates).
    </p>
    <h3>the Facebook Event</h3>
    <p>
      <img src="assets/cosplaystuff/20240827/23ebd15de4385979e6b82ce0e1919e1e.png" alt="">
      &mdash; <cite>preview banner for Limay Leg, Act 1</cite>
    </p>
    <p>
      I immediately provisioned the Facebook Event after prepping the website (the
      latter took a while than I thought so I kinda moved the schedule quite a bit),
      which gained some traction cuz of my cos moots!!
    </p>
    <p>
      however, since my schedsheet has been updated and I had quite some legs to run
      cuz of circumstances (which I&#39;ll get to later); I decided that instead of
      Aug-Sep, I made it Aug-Dec!! <em>(for more info, go check out
      <a rel="noopener noreferrer"
        href="https://thebelovedmoon.github.io/?vt=cosplay"
        target="_blank">the cosplay section of my website</a>.)</em>
    </p>
    <h3>some rescheduling hiccups</h3>
    <p><em>
      this&#39;ll relate to the circumstance that we&#39;ll get to later, but 
      here&#39;s the gist: I moved to a new province, so it took some time to get
      the event going.
    </em></p>
    <p>
      come the day of the event, I planned ahead of schedule thinking that
      everything should be fine by then; but I got to a point where things
      aren&#39;t what they seem. this includes the duration of commute from my new
      neighborhood to the starting point, as well as prepping my outfits (which is
      the usual). took a while to prepare, so I had to adjust the time a coupla
      times.
    </p>
    <p>
      first it was 12pm PHT (since the original start time was an hr before), then
      to 2:30pm PHT; but we all decided to arrive 30mins after the second one. kind
      of a hassle, but somehow the event-goers were alright with it as they&#39;ve
      also been in some circumstances as mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      anyhow, once we got around to our meeting place, everything went absolutely
      well!! took some pictures and some snacks, while enjoying some chit-chat.
      somehow I&#39;m a little odd since I already came fully dressed-up. XD
    </p>
    <p>
      on the next section, I&#39;ll introduce you to the two cosers who accompanied
      me during the inaugural tour!! you probably might have heard of or seen them
      before in previous conventions I attended, but they remain significant as
      I&#39;ll be inviting them to other legs if they want~
    </p>
    <h2>meet the cosers</h2>
    <h3>Chowji</h3>
    <!-- <p>
      I first saw Chowji back at MalCon 2024 Bataan Leg D2 during the cosplay
      competition (to which he surprisingly won hands-down) as Foxy!! which somehow
      reminded me of FNAF cuz of Markimoo..
    </p> -->
    <p>
      <img src="assets/cosplaystuff/20240827/94be84b362f2794ba5c1a2cd9ab08d20.jpg" alt="">
      &mdash; <cite>cred. Berlyndg for MalCon 2024</cite>
    </p>
    <p>
      I first saw Chowji back at MalCon 2024 Bataan Leg D3 where he portrayed as
      Foxy (where he straight-up won hands-down)!! first impression, he&#39;s
      actually very chill; and he&#39;s usually engaging into the conversation~
    </p>
    <p>
      somehow the funniest part that got us hooked to FNAF was that at one point he
      and I discussed about Wolverine jumpscare and how that ties in perfectly with
      Foxy&#39;s (from FNAF2), see GIFs below:
    </p>    
    <p>
      <img src="https://media1.tenor.com/m/2FdfITpaejAAAAAC/wolverine-jumpscare-deadpool-and-wolverine.gif" alt="" width="480px">

      <img src="assets/cosplaystuff/20240827/bd6388f481c0f8e55340cbf962902ce5.webp" alt="" width="480px">
    </p>
    <p>
      anyway, the key takeaway here is that he&#39;s pretty much into FNAF as much
      as I do, and somehow he came in a very simplistic fashion (albeit with a
      parrot puppet for some reason); but hey, I feel like liking the guy than I
      initially thought!!
    </p>
    <h3>Shunni</h3>
    <p>
      <img
        src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/r2pKfVrrt3w/hq720.jpg"
        alt=""
        title="see the highlight"
        onclick="window.open('https://youtu.be/r2pKfVrrt3w', '_blank')"
        style="cursor: pointer; pointer-events: all;">
    </p>
    <p>
      I crossed paths with Shunni -- Shu-Shu as I call her -- waaay back at BACon
      2024, tho I don&#39;t recall having interactions with her that day. I almost
      mistaken her for another coser cuz of this fact lmao
    </p>
    <p>
      anyhow, the real interaction started on her end during one of my usual
      walkarounds at SM City Bataan (<a
        rel="noopener noreferrer"
        href="https://facebook.com/share/p/Fm1PnrfZC5pEootU"
        target="_blank"
        >logged 25 Jun</a
      >), where she replied that she saw me on the bus from Balanga to LimayüòÖ (she
      told me that she was too shy aaaaaa-)
    </p>
    <p>
      I don&#39;t know how, but my guts told me to meet her whenever I do tours and
      whatnot; so it feels like this is a perfect opportunity!!
    </p>
    <p>
      first impressions? she&#39;s also as chill as Chowji, but with a bit of
      shyness cuz I could feel that she came (kinda) unprepared?? altho I have to
      admit: seeing her up close also made me feel a bit shy cuz it&#39;s my first
      time seeing her up close and personal, so I kinda assumed that there&#39;s a
      personality switch between being a coser and irl?? xd
    </p>
    <p>
      buuuuut being with her almost felt the same as being with Eri (the incumbent
      Third CosMaria) since they both radiated the same vibe!! on that note I might
      be able to invite Eri on the next legs..
    </p>
    <p>
      in a nutshell; she might still be a bit shy as she stated in the replies, but
      I can sense that she&#39;ll be doing alright!!
    </p>
    <p>I might invite her on the next leg, but should I give her a costume??</p>
    <h4>did you know..</h4>
    <p>that she also has another alias -- YƒÅng Chi?? yeh, even I'm surprised!!</p>
    <h2>about future legs..</h2>
    <p>so here comes the part that might surprise everybody:</p>
    <p>
      following the recent circumstances involving my recent
      <em>actual</em> employment, it might have seem that the dates have changed
      which seems to not align with the projected range of Aug-Sep.
    </p>
    <p>
      HOWEVER; I can assure you that even tho it might be the case, I can still do
      the activities during the day!! as stipulated on the below vod, I was assigned
      to night shifts, so I still have my schedule on deck!! (just that they all
      have to be adjusted either way.)
