    <h1 style="text-align: center;">so, some changes have been made to the Bataan Tour..</h1>
    <br>
    <p>
      <strong>IN A NUTSHELL:</strong> the Tour will still continue, but under
      irregular intervals as schedules between professional work are considered. all
      notifications regarding change of events are reported early before the planned
      events take place moving forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      so, remember when I told you guys about what happend during the first week
      since the move? if you haven&#39;t, you can check out the following vod below:

    </p>
    <p>
      basically, it all boils down to me having to do some professional work since
      I&#39;ve been employed some weeks ago <span redactText>(spoiler: it&#39;s a
      BPO company as I need to gauge my English comprehension)</span>, which causes
      a HUUUGE change in how I work on a normal basis; especially when it comes to
      scheduling since most of my shifts are gauged at night.
    </p>
    <p>
      which also poses another problem in of itself: I might need to wait it out
      until my salary is received <span redactText>(atm they&#39;re allotted to once
      every 2wks, disbursed every Fri of wk.2)</span> before I can embark in more 
      ventures, since I&#39;m fully aware that they cost a lot for transportation
      and even buying the basic goods. (welcome to the Philippines, where we sell 
      goods for cheap!! /s)
    </p>
    <p>
      anyhow, <strong>what does it mean for the ongoing Bataan Tour and the upcoming
      Balanga Tour Special??</strong> it all boils down to two things:
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          upcoming tours going forward will be adjusted to specific timeframes, which
          are viewable via the dedicated website
        </li>
        <li>
          for the Balanga Tour Special, there will be two outcomes: assuming the pay
          is within this week (8-14 Sep), it will be put in place (with printing done
          by Saturday morning); otherwise, it will follow the first one
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      with regards to the Orion Leg, there will also be adjustments as it also falls
      the scope of my employment routines; meaning that it will be taken place at a
      later date.
    </p>
    <p>
      (I also need to consider other expenses, one of them being A55 5G as Emi
      desperately needed one to replace the J7 Pro; which I will then take that over
      following the acquisition)
    </p>
    <p>
