    <h1 style="text-align: center;">despite everything, the Balanga Leg Special is a success!!</h1>
    <br>
    <p>
      I&#39;m still a bit shocked about what had happend during the past few days
      leading up to the event, with the most significant being that my phone was
      lost on my way home last 14 Sep. but thanks to my cos fwens, I can atleast
      have some photos to share!!
    </p>
    <p>
      also, I would like to thank some of the CosMarias in advance for accompanying
      me throughout the journey as we plow through the Balanga Leg Special even with
      turbulence on our shoulders!! they are exactly what I&#39;ve been looking for
      as a CosMaria -- being able to support their fellows and others in times of
      need and uncertainties. I couldn&#39;t have been here without their support
      and worry, and I&#39;m committed to return the favor tenfold; more on that as
      you read the article!!
    </p>
    <h3>before Gakuen-Sai</h3>
    <p>
      for a quick rundown of what just happend before the Balanga Leg Special (aka
      Gakuen-Sai 2024), you can refer to the following vods below:

    <h2>Connxt: Gakuen-Sai 2024</h2>
    <p>
      despite the many hurdles that had inflicted, we carried on our promise to
      deliver the Tour and have attended Gakuen-Sai 2024!! I may not have my phone
      on hand anymore, but I do have my laptop to make up for it!!
    </p>

      &mdash; <cite>one of the three selfies taken from the laptop!! (with my first hairclip)</cite>
    </p>
    <p>
      there was an upcoming Singing Competition when I arrived (at around 2-3pm PHT)
      and I could see some familiar faces straight-up -- especially Shi-Shi!!
      <em>you&#39;ll be hearing more of her more often as you progress through this
      blog.</em>
    </p>
    <h3>apparently, how were the competitions?</h3>
    <p>
      the Singing Competition, if I&#39;m being half-honest, were necessarily not
      that half-bad either!! I&#39;m a bit concerned about the impacts from both
      parties since the first half was kinda meh.. that&#39;s according to the
      audiences as I&#39;ve observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      regardless, as the first competition progresses, it became more livelier than
      ever; with more contestants aiming to hype up the crowd!! somehow I felt like
      cheering from my seat for the constestants regardless of their performance as
      sort of a confidence boost -- even for a lil bit~
    </p>
    <p>
      the Cosplay Competition is where they actually took the cake for being this
      awesome -- most of the performances I&#39;ve seen out of everything had me
      jumping from my seat -- even tho I was actually standing from a booth. (I was
      at the Cosplayer Avenue with other guest cosers when the competition happend
      cuz I was demoing Shi-Shi how I usually work on websites like this --
      signifying the continuation of our devtalks~)
    </p>
    <p>
      in some cases, I can see some familiar face or two onstage -- most notably,
      Chowji!! (for more details, check out this
      <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="20240827" target="_blank">article</a>.)
    </p>

    </p>
    <h3>during the walkaround..</h3>
    <p>
      during the Singing Competition, I actually wandered around the booths to see
      if there are any booths of interest that I can make an article about -- and
      for some reason, I rekindled with Haryu again!! what a small world despite
      that I moved to Pampanga..
    </p>
    <p>
      for those uninitiated, she was one of the people I met back at BACon (Bataan
      Anime Convention) 2024; which she actually had her own booth when I dropped
      by!! for more reference, refer to this
      <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="20240506" target="_blank">article</a>.
    </p>

      &mdash; <cite>Haryu and I back at BACon 2024</cite>
    </p>
    <p>
      in addition, I also went to other booths and mingled with some of them --
      whilst also giving them some cards and A5 prints!! some of them were even
      generous to even provide me with some of their items in exchange!! more on
      that later.
    </p>
    <h2>Gakuen-Sai announce</h2>
    <p>
      I&#39;ve made the following announce for the event!! it may seem a bit simple
      but that&#39;s how I got with.. (also made some several adjustments to the
      graphic for some odd reason lmao)
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="assets/cosplaystuff/20240922/004fedd8d459dd5086516212e22210e8.png" alt="">
    </p>
    <p>
      also, I recently participated in the Confessions and Shout-Outs where I send
      out my confession as displayed below:
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="assets/cosplaystuff/20240922/aed67d6aad69b0c0b4ef813e88c75c98.jpg" alt="">
    </p>
    <p>primary reaction cuz this somehow blew up: Eri??!?!?!</p>
    <h2>so, what are the items expected during the event??</h2>
    <p><em>
      in a nutshell, they&#39;re the same items that were featured during MalCon
      2024 Bataan Leg, but with few differences.
    </em></p>
    <p>
      have a look at the following items below as we discuss them in full detail:
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="assets/cosplaystuff/20240922/fb8a0d27130c7d812b23d94b3b199eb7.png" alt="">
      &mdash; <cite>items may be the same, but they're in fact different in some areas!!</cite>
    </p>
    <h3>contact cards</h3>
    <p>
      some of the included contact cards are of the same variety as the last con --
      except for the one below. I kinda made it a habit to replace the second logo
      with whatever con I participated in.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="assets/cosplaystuff/20240922/62c716c2b101447bd551ca59c15612f9.png" alt="" width="475px">
      &mdash; <cite>the new contact card!!</cite>
    </p>
    <h3>placard</h3>
    <p>
      the new placard (shown below) may be smaller than its smaller counterpart, but
      it sure packs the punch!! also, I&#39;ve featured the Bataan Tour logo as an
      added bonus since the con occurred during the major event~
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="assets/cosplaystuff/20240922/3cdd59cd6a79ce568002e62c44836841.png" alt="">
      &mdash; <cite>the new placard!!</cite>
    </p>
    <h3>A5 prints</h3>
    <p>
      I&#39;ve sent out a number of A5 prints, but below is the most exclusive as I
      only produced only two of them due to issues on how I printed em. BUT,
      they&#39;re all to be treated as exclusives anyway -- one for Shi-Shi and the
      other for the organizers!!
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="assets/cosplaystuff/20240922/998d835589463a29d7d38d107b49bec7.png" alt="">
      &mdash; <cite>the A5 print exclusive!!</cite>
    </p>
    <h3>so, what makes them different from the previous con??</h3>
    <p>
      the only major difference is that not only the A5 prints but also the contact
      cards will be signed on the spot!! on the last con, it&#39;s only the A5
      prints that are signed..
    </p>
    <p>
      I&#39;ve recently acquired a new marker to do the job for me, which turned out
      quite well!!
    </p>
    <p>
      also, the placard is also signed, albeit by fellow guest cosers; which will be
      brought during the post-con discussion as you read this blog.
    </p>
    <h2>with the CosMarias</h2>
    <p>
      now here comes the most significant part where I usually stick around with the
      fellow CosMarias!! unfortunately, Eri (the incumbent Third CosMaria) isn&#39;t
      with me as she might have some circumstances during my time here (and the fact
      that she just attended GachaFest in SM City Olongapo days before this event);
      but I&#39;m still not alone during my presence!!
      <strong>enter Shunni and Shira, our upcoming Fourth and Sixth CosMarias!!</strong>
    </p>
    <h3>Shunni, the upcoming Fourth CosMaria</h3>
    <p>
      Shunni -- or Shuui as I call her going forward (more on that later) -- first
      appeared on my radar during BACon 2024, altho she wasn&#39;t really much of a
      significance during that time period. however, subsequent interactions had led
      the connection forward, starting off with the time she found me at a bus on my
      way home during one of my visits to SM City Bataan.
    </p>
    <p>
      anyhow, our first meetup came on the Limay Leg of the Bataan Tour!! she&#39;s
      still a bit shy, but it&#39;s still nice knowing that she&#39;s getting used
      to this kind of interactions outside of conventions!!
    </p>
    <p>
      anyhow, she and I met again during the event, to which she was eager to have
      me on board!! we mostly talked about what had happend after the Limay Leg and
      my ongoing circumstances, to which she was eager to help out!! she was even
      eager to keep our memories through pictures -- that one thing that really
      surprises me the most!! not just the photoshoots, but also our selfies
      together!! (some of the photos included in the collection were from hers.)
    </p>
    <p>
      in exchange, I gave her the CosMaria card and the card/s of her choice, signed
      on spot!!
    </p>
    <p>here are some of the photos as outlined below:</p>

      &mdash; <cite>together with the placard!!</cite>
    </p>
    <h3>Shira, the upcoming Sixth CosMaria</h3>
    <p>
      remember in the previous paragraphs that there was the Singing Competition
      that&#39;s due to start when I arrived?? turns out, Shira -- aka Shi-Shi --
      was one of the judges for the event!! I somehow called up to her before the
      event started, but decided to wait until the event finishes to which I took a
      look around.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="assets/cosplaystuff/20240922/c4b8e5677de1fc31facab700d23bf691.jpg" alt="">
      &mdash; <cite>Shi-Shi as C.C. from Code Geass!! (cred. Dave Salas for Connxt)</cite>
    </p>
    <p>
      anyway, when the competition ended, I somehow found myself accompanying her
      around the venue as she asked me why I didn&#39;t attend on Day 1 -- to which I
      spilt the details to her firsthand. I can understand the concern in her eyes
      considering that I replied to her before that I would be attending on that
      supposed day, but can&#39;t due to circumstances as outlined at the beginning
      of this blog.
    </p>
    <p>
      we somehow chatted for a while and got ourselves into some interesting
      conversations with some of the guest cosers around the Cosplay Avenue, to
      which I feel is a privilege in of itself since I wanna connect to the fellows
      -- one of the responsibilities as a CosMaria!! in turn, to continue our
      devtalks from the last con, I demoed how I ususally work on my websites like
      this one (cuz I have my laptop with me during the event). some of the
      onlookers somehow noticed the demo, to which one of them shared his experience
      as a dev!! it appears that my dev circle has begun to expand, one person at a
      time..
    </p>
    <p>
      in addition, being alongside her led to some of the interesting instances;
      which some of them are surprising even for me!! take this one reel for
      example:
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      on the above reel, you can already see me at the very behind of the group,
      wondering what in the world was going on; with Shi-Shi beside me as she gets
      around her booth!!
    </p>
    <p>
      anyhow, there are also some instances to which I was really grateful about,
      such as being able to have the confidence with her at my side as the Cosplay
      Catwalk was coming up. altho I didn&#39;t conquer the runway, atleast I was
      able to get the word out with the placard on hand!! I also cheered for her and
      her accomplices as the three of them got onto the stage -- one of them being
      Issaki, to which I&#39;ll discuss later.
    </p>
    <p>
      she also stuck with me even during the breaks and after the event, to which I
      was grateful enough for her unwavering presence during those times!! at one
      point, she even offered me a slice of pizza (to which I knew came from
      Greenwich); which brings back memories back at BACon 2024 cuz before I
      formally attended the event I headed to that fastfood chain to eat some lunch.
    </p>
    <p>
      after the event, she accompanied me (along with her other accomplices) around
      booths to see if there are some things that piques my interest. she even went
      as far as letting me pick the items (at her expense) as her gesture of saying
      &quot;thank you&quot; for the fun time during the conventions. I was kind of
      crying when she gifted me most of the stuff (to which I&#39;ll reveal later)
      and even saying that she was eager to seeing me again in the next cons to
      which she&#39;ll be available!!
    </p>
    <p>
      during one of those conversations, she even mentioned that she miiight give me
      one of her wigs that kind of match with my existing one -- but longer. she was
      supposed to be carrying that before the event, but I understood the concern;
      both of us agreeing on the trade once we cross paths on the next con.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><strong><em>did you know..</em></strong></p>
      <p>Shira was the one who suggested the new nickname for Shunni?</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h2>reuniting with Issaki</h2>
    <p>
      part of rekindling with fellow cosers is the fact that I somehow try to know
      them just by their face and who they portray.
    </p>
    <p>
      Issaki Murazaki -- aka Issa -- is basically that. I might not have been
      physically aware of her during BACon 2024, but I primarily know her for her
      portrayal as Bayonetta.
    </p>
    <p>and how do I know this? take a look at the below screencap:</p>
    <p>
      <img
        src="assets/cosplaystuff/20240922/a910832bae698431e875e968b0f8c65c.jpg"

        title="see the highlight"
        onclick="window.open('https://youtu.be/zkBxRUlU_eA', '_blank')"
        style="cursor: pointer; pointer-events: all;">
      &mdash; <cite>uploader: LeMewRe FX</cite>
    </p>
    <p>
      she and I discussed about it!! she was also surprised as I am cuz she was kind
      of unaware of her surroundings during the shoots that she also didn&#39;t
      notice me wandering around whose cosers to shoot for my photo documentation
      (during that period).
    </p>
    <p>
      she kind of also admitted that it&#39;s her first time as a guest cosplayer
      for a convention, which adds to that surprise levels; but from what I saw
      she&#39;s doing just as alright as she is at current!! maybe that confidence
      boost from her fans eased that uncertainty, I think.
    </p>

    <h2>post-event thoughts and hauls</h2>
    <p>
      now that we&#39;re done with the features, thoughts, and interactions with our
      fellow cosers and CosMarias, time to take a lil unwinding and reflect on what
      has been an almost-impossible journey back after many circumstances through
      the merch hauls and other stuff!!
    </p>
    <p>
      for the record, I&#39;m feeling more relieved knowing that despite the odds,
      I&#39;ve done the impossible and made it in time!! in turn, I get to see more
      what meets the eye: guest cosers, merch, and even more memories along the
      way!!
    </p>
    <p>
      and thanks to Shi-Shi, I got some of the merch as well as tokens of our
      continuing friendship and our ongoing commitment as CosMarias!!
    </p>
    <p>here are some of them:</p>

    <h3>what about the placard??</h3>
    <p>
      along with the hauls and me signing the cards and prints, I somehow felt
      privileged to showcase some autographs from our fellow guest cosers!!
      <strong>I would like to thank Shi-Shi, Issa, and Lia Bear for the
      autographs!!</strong> I will be cherishing them forever uhuhu :3

    <h2>to the organizers of Gakuen-Sai..</h2>
    <p>
      it has been a fulfilling experience despite the odds, and I&#39;m grateful for
      everything you all have done to make the event as lively as I expected!! like
      I said in the handwritten note -- this event has been awesome in every way
      possible, and I&#39;m glad to experience it in full!!
    </p>
    <p>
      I have made a promise to myself as a CosMaria to remain committed to my work
      despite the odds; and this proves that no matter what happens behind the
      scenes, everything can be achieved as long as we&#39;re working together to
      make things happen!!
    </p>
    <p>
      expect a Letter from the First Maria🍃 with the rerelease of the Marias&#39;
      website -- due on 27 Dec 2024.

    <h2>TL;DR</h2>
    <p>
      went through the article but still didn&#39;t understand anything? here&#39;s
      a quick summary to get you up to speed:
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>lost my phone before Gakuen-Sai</li>
        <li>met Chowji and Haryu again!!</li>
        <li>rekindled with Shuui and Shi-Shi -- two of our upcoming CosMarias</li>
        <li>Mother meets Bayonetta.. sorta</li>
        <li>merch hauls and selfies!!</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      it has been a tumultuous journey this past week before the event; and despite
      the bad circumstances, it all ended on a good note!! I couldn&#39;t have done
      it more without our fellow CosMarias and other cosers to back ourselves up,
      and everyone who has supported the cosplay scene since day 1!!
    </p>
    <p>
      regarding the next steps for the Bataan Tour, it might take a lil more than
      just planning to get things done. but rest assured the event is still going --
