    <h1 style="text-align: center;">the first-ever cosplay experience in Pampanga!!</h1>
    <br>
    <p>
      never in my years I would dream that I'd go BEYOND Bataan for my routine
      cosplays. today is the first time that I get to experience an inter-provincial
      experience, courtesy of Vista Mall Pampanga through #MalCon2024 Pampanga Leg
      Day 2!!
    </p>
    <h2>Malolos Convention 2024: Pampanga Leg</h2>
    <p>
      as the title suggests, this is the "Round 2" of the MalCon Series to which I'm
      involved in!! somehow, this brings back memories because the first time I went
      to MalCon for this series was back at Bataan for their own leg -- which I
      attended for a day and half (I went to D2 at 5pm PHT, then somewhat fully on
      D3). in addition, since my line of professional work is around Pampanga, I
      thought I could use that as the next base for my cosplay ops going forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      now you may be asking: why Pampanga, and why don't you go back to Bataan for
      cosplays? primary reason is that I'll return to Bataan every two weeks (unless
      it's urgent business), and primary locations (more specifically malls) were
      easily accessible through public transport since they run on a single route
      for most cases. one primary example is that I toured around Laus Group (the
      headquarters of CLTV36) one night after work. I usually see the building
      whenever I pass by it on my way to Metro Manila and back, so seeing it up
      close feels like a dream come true!!

    <h2>changes made since the last con</h2>
    <p>
      in a nutshell, nothing much; except a few things: updated placard,
      introduction of ID cards, and an invitation to the mix -- among other things!!
      let's take a look at some of these:
    </p>

    </p>
    <h3>updated placard</h3>
    <p>
      for some reason, I was about to reuse the old placard which I first debuted
      during MalCon 2024 Bataan Leg, but then this happend.
    </p>

      in a nutshell, I was about to open <code>vtm_widescreen.psd</code> cuz I need
      to update a few things, but the external HDD where it was located decided to
      disconnect on its own and it errored out along with Photoshop. when I tried to
      reopen the file, it was corrupted -- prompting me to restart. surprise,
      surprise; the file has inevitably ceased from existence, and the tempfiles
      didn't help even a single bit.
    </p>
    <p>
      despite the disappointment, however, I was able to recreate the placard;
      however, everything else is lost to time. I could reiterate the lost ones
      through images when they were submitted, however, they may take some time.
    </p>
    <p>
      in any case, it got a lil update following the recreation!! check out the
      graphic below:
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      immediately as I summon the placard, some people turned their heads -- with
      the most being MalCon organizers; with the emcee acknowledging my presence
      back in Bataan!! I guess we've come full circle again after like the last time
      uhuhu
    </p>

      &mdash; <cite>cred. Berlyndg for MalCon 2024</cite>
    </p>
    <p>
      before I depart from the event, I immediately had to make it extra special by
      SIGNING the placard -- smth that also happend during the
      <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="20240922" target="_blank"
        >Gakuen-Sai Special</a
      >, but unfortunately it got lost in transit on the way home. I felt kinda
      devastated cuz it had been with me when I disembark on multiple PUJs, but I
      still have an ace up my sleeve: I'll be reprinting them again for the sake of
      archiving, but lacking the autograph. (luckily the autographs were saved on
      different cos cards, in which I'll be showing later.)
    </p>
    <h3>A5 prints and ID cards</h3>
    <p>
      you may have noticed that whilst the A5 prints stayed the same, the minicards
      (last featured on the Gakuen-Sai Special) were shrunk to ID cards!! the main
      reason behind it is that it allows me to have more space for the other cards
      to be printed alongside, reducing the printing load any printer will take. in
      addition, since they are going to be cut when it's all done, we have an option
      to cut them all at once!!
    </p>
    <p>
      and of course, the paper that was used for these also have changed: whilst
      photo paper is what I used since I first introduced them during the Bataan
      Leg, I realized that it may not be practical in the long run due to the nature
      of which prints were maintained on paper. so with the Pampanga Leg, I opted
      for a watermarked laid paper; which significantly helped as it also means that
      whatever prints made will be sure that it stays there -- tho I might need some
      time before I can draw a conclusion to that sort.
    </p>
    <p>
      since we're still on the topic of cards, atleast for the ID cards,
      autographing them is a lil difficult cuz you need to leave a space for the
      autograph. so I decided that ID cards will be autographed from behind. A5
      prints is as-is as with the previous cons.
    </p>
    <h3>invitations</h3>
    <p>
      it'll be ways off until the first-ever major event "Inauguration of the
      CosMarias" takes place, but it's better to be ready than not!! as part of the
      word-of-mouth approach, I've decided to craft a design that will fit the
      invitational, welcoming everyone to the party!!
    </p>
    <p>
      later on in the article, we'll be discussing what will be the details of the
      event; alongside who will be attending the event, and which area of the venue
      will be used to accommodate the said event.
    </p>
    <h2>want those photo resources?</h2>
    <p>
      are you curious about more content other than the one mentioned here?? look no
      further -- I've compiled all of em (including past cosplays I did) in a
      unified G Drive folder!! each cosplays are grouped into folders named in
      YYYYMMDD dateformat -- with the first attempt (and my debut as a cosplayer)
      being 20231230!!

    <h3>can I use these resources?</h3>
    <p>
      absolutely!! you're all set to check out some of the photos I've taken and the
      cosplays I did -- granted that you'll be using them with intent of goodwill.
