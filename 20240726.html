    <br>
    <p><i>
      this is also the convention that I officially provisioned the CosMarias --
      which consisted of myself, Musashi, and Albedo!! more on that as you read
      the article.
    </i></p>
    <br><br>
    <p>
      this is the second-overall local convention that I attended that is closer to
      home!! but I didn&#39;t expect that there&#39;s something more than just a
      simple presence to the event -- to make it even more extra special, I&#39;ve
      added some daring stunts to the mix. let&#39;s have a look:
    </p>
    <h2>Malolos Convention 2024: Bataan Leg</h2>
    <p>
      anyone might not have heard of this event, and even I too initially; but after
      getting wind of it via Facebook (to which I primarily use that for everything
      #AgaCosplay), I&#39;ve been hyping it non-stop -- hoping to get the word out
      about this venture even with this limited reach that I currently have.
    </p>
    <p>
      in contrast to
      <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="20240506">Bataan Anime Convention 2024</a>
      tho, I&#39;ve done more than just showing up, looking at booths, and mingling
      with fellow cosers!! as part of this hype, I&#39;ve done more than just that
      -- let&#39;s have a look at the following:
    </p>

    <h3>makeshift placard</h3>
    <p>

      &mdash; <cite>cred. Berlyndg for MalCon 2024</cite>
    </p>
    <p>
      first off, I actually went ahead and printed the tarpapel (tarpaulin but made
      of paper) to be used for the convention, which is the first that I did in a
      long time. to be honest, I haven&#39;t had the thought process to do that
      during the previous con cuz I&#39;ve been hasting much..
    </p>
    <p>
      but, now with some preparations out of the way (and ahead of schedule, albeit
      they almost tie in with my call time); the next thing to do is to let the
      placard do the work -- which actually attracted attention.. so I can&#39;t go
      back now lmaoüòÖ
    </p>
    <p>for those who were curious, below is the graphic that became a placard:</p>
    <p>

      &mdash; <cite>&quot;the First Maria has arrived!&quot;</cite>
    </p>
    <p>
      that somehow became the most significant out of the three as it not only allow
      me to wave the flag of what Collective I represent in my own way, this
      actually attracted some attention -- which actually helped me get the word
      out!!
    </p>
    <p>
      speaking of attention, the staff I stumbled across with were very
      accommodating and pretty chill for the most part -- kinda more than fulfilling
      to say the least!!
    </p>

      a lil note on this one: I debuted the placard during Day 2 of the event, and
      it continued until Day 3.
    </i></p>
    <h3>mini contact cards</h3>
    <p>
      <img src="blog-assets/cosplaystuff/20240726/89b8ee09886c420d297313ef538b7dca.jpg" alt="" width="475px">
      &mdash; <cite>all the contact cards and A5 prints!! (Day 3)</cite>
    </p>
    <p>
      this one took some effort as I&#39;ve been working on the cards and their
      revisions since post-BACon 2024. in fact, I actually had this idea of having
      myself some cards to distribute after receiving some from the booths during
      that event!!
    </p>
    <p>
      in essence, these designs took a hell lot so I decided I&#39;ll put something
      simple for the time being. I didn&#39;t know that actually went well with what
      I anticipated since I wanted it to remain simple -- much like what I currently
      have in regards to streaming assets and my current model.
    </p>
    <p>
      I&#39;ve given out just one type of cards during Day 2, but I actually went
      ahead with more designs for Day 3. here are the following:
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      admittedly, I had to print them in photo paper since I don&#39;t have a vellum
      on-hand at the time of the event, but it sure packs the punch!! most cards
      given to me during BACon 2024 were vellum and similar types (some of em are
      very fancy), so I had to improvise for the sake of giving these out.

    </p>
    <p>
      as of writing this blog, I still have some extra cards in the inventory; but I
      plan to make more variants as per demand (specifically ShiraCoser, we&#39;ll
      get to that topic later) for the next con. who knows, maybe more than just a
      one-sided print??
    </p>
    <h3>A5 prints</h3>
    <p>
      as a specialty for Day 3, I&#39;ve prepped an extra-special merch for the
      congoers: an A5 print of a selection of my favorite stuff!! they include the
      following:
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>V‰∏â‰∫∫„ÅÆ„Éû„É™„Ç¢ illust</li>
        <li>the first cosplay visual</li>
        <li>the official illust (from the Third Mariaüå∏)</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="blog-assets/cosplaystuff/20240726/4b5cea0af4d0e3d731a6284039e3ec2b.png" alt="">
      &mdash; <cite>one of the three A5 prints, featuring the first illust as Marias</cite>
    </p>
    <p>
      and to make it <strong>EVEN MORE</strong> special, I included in my PR on
      Facebook before attending the event that anyone who gets the A5 print will
      have it autographed on the spot!! and the way I did the autograph is a lil
      basic -- I basically wrote the Japanese Kanji equivalent of my vtuber name on
      it!!
    </p>
    <p>
      so far, I made a total of 6 prints -- two each -- with the final one sent to
      the organizers during the final auction event!!
    </p>
    <h2>new cos moot: ShiraCoser</h2>
    <p>

      &mdash; <cite>Shira and I during Day 3 of the event</cite>
    </p>
    <p>
      finally made a new fwen during the event!! Shira&#39;s one of the featured
      cosers during the event, to which I actually swung by her booth during my time
      there. (coincidentally, that happend with Dani cuz I hung out around her booth
      for who knows how long lmao)
    </p>
    <p>
      we talked a lot of different things, including how I came up with my cosplay
      -- with one notable response saying that I somehow look like my own model,
      which is a lil flattering but honored regardless!!
    </p>
    <p>
      (I also remembered her surprised look when I gave her the provisional contact
      card -- since the website where this blog lies were powered by GitHub, she
      recognized it almost immediately!! felt like it&#39;s my first time meeting
      someone who&#39;s not just a coser but also a developer, like me!!)
    </p>
    <p>
      in addition to the cards, I also gave her one of my A5 prints (specifically
      the official illust as pictured below), which was signed on the spot!! in
      exchange, she gave me one of her photocards, also signed on the spot~
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="blog-assets/cosplaystuff/20240726/e6c9b98f25c26b8aa2b3d94c743dbee6.jpg" alt="">
      &mdash; <cite>all of Shira's merch hauls, post-Day 3</cite>
    </p>
    <p>
      come Day 3 she and I got involved with more event segments, to which she was
      the judge.. afaik it was with the Anime Singing Contest; and also sang for the
      audience!! after the meetup post-contest tho we haven&#39;t interacted much
      since I had to wander around and get involved with more cosers -- including
      holding some mini-reunions ahead of Matsuri 2024. (more on that in the next
      section.)
    </p>
    <p>
      but that all changed when the final auction segment came up -- since I&#39;m
      already at the front-row seat during the seg, I figured I had to take some
      pictures of the items and its winning bidders. during those times, someone
      from her booth requested to the emcee that her tarpaulin be auctioned -- so
      judging from her reaction, I&#39;d say she&#39;s quite more than surprised by
      the decision!!
    </p>
    <p>
      everyone began hyping up in a bid to take the tarpaulin -- which was closed at
      thousands of Philippine Pesos (iirc). I actually called up to her when the bid
      closed thoüòÖ all in all, it was a pretty fun experience to get along with!!

    <h2>a reunion to remember: provisioning of CosMarias</h2>
    <p>
      it&#39;s been a while since I got in touch with my fellow cosers since BACon
      2024, which actually made me continue on with my cosplay ventures!! during
      those times, however, I wanted to give something that inspires them to
      continue doing what they love -- especially the two cosers that I&#39;ve met
      that had a major significance to me as a coser and as a person.
    </p>
    <p>
      with it, I&#39;ve made a decision to provision another Collective that adheres
      to the Marias&#39; Core Values: to be universal, and to accept who we are.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="https://thebelovedmoon.github.io/assets/images/content/firstMaria/cosplay/cosplayMaria_wp.png" alt="">
      &mdash; <cite>can you identify the other two cosers who represent these characters behind me??</cite>
    </p>
    <p>
      in fact, one of the incumbent CosMarias also happend to participate in this
      event, as well as in the previous one!! does that ring a bell??!
    </p>
    <p>
      that&#39;s right -- <strong>Eri, the incumbent Third CosMaria</strong> -- has
      returned to Vista Mall Bataan for Days 2 and 3 of the event!!
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="blog-assets/cosplaystuff/20240726/3a1e785435c27551936383f19ee080ef.jpg" alt="">
      &mdash; <cite>Eri and I on Day 3!! she represented as Momobami Kirari from Kakegurui :3 (antagonist gang??!)</cite>
    </p>
    <p>
      in actuality, she also happened to participate on Day 2 where I also made my
      appearance -- but for some reason we haven&#39;t caught up with each other qwq
    </p>
    <p>
      for those who are curious, she represented as Kamui Kanna from Kobayashi-san
      Chi no Maid Dragon, as seen below:

      &mdash; <cite>cred. Emmanuel Calina</cite>
    </p>
    <p>
      as a lil extra, I also reunited with another fellow coser Yue, who previously
      represented as Maomao from Apothecary Diaries. during our reunion, she became
      Shouyou Hinata from Haikyuu!! (might wanna watch that anime again..)
    </p>

    </p>
    <h3>so, what is CosMarias??</h3>
    <p>
      Cosplay Marias -- abbrev. CosMarias -- is a Collective that acts just like
      VTresMarias, but mainly focuses on cosplays as main entry points!! just like
      the Marias, the Collective primarily consists of three cosers from different
      walks of life, focused on the same goals that adhere to the Marias&#39; Core
      Values!!
    </p>
    <p>
      coincidentally, the First MariaüçÉ is also designated as the First CosMaria --
      supporting her fellow Marias and CosMarias as they push through with their own
      destinies!!
    </p>
    <p>at its current roster, the incumbent CosMarias consist of:</p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>Aga, the First CosMaria (as Mother Agatha, the First MariaüçÉ)</li>
        <li>Dani, the Second CosMaria (as Musashi from Azur Lane)</li>
        <li>Eri, the Third CosMaria (as Albedo from Overlord)</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>what are the perks of being a CosMaria??</h3>
    <p>
      at current, I&#39;ve already given Eri an exclusive card, signifying her
      designation into the new Collective. pictured below is the exact same graphic
      I gave to her:

    <p>
      I&#39;m currently planning on making more merch to give out to them in future
      conventions!!
    </p>
    <p><i>
      (on an unrelated note, I actually gave Shira -- I call her Shi-Shi -- the same
      card to let her in on the scoop on what this new Collective is about.)

    <h2>the new cosplay visual</h2>
    <p>
      a special thanks to Emmanuel Calina for hitting me up again after the first
      cos visual back at BACon 2024!! I gotta admit, I&#39;m a bit sassy in that
      visual, but Idk which pose would suit me best so I kinda improvised on my own
      lmao
    </p>

      also, I didn&#39;t notice that I didn&#39;t wear my belt (I left it at home)
      during Day 2 where this visual was taken, which make it seem like I went back
      to the original look aaaaa-
    </p>
    <h2>to the organizers and coordinators who made the Bataan Leg possible..</h2>
    <p>
      it&#39;s been quite a read, but I wanna close another chapter in our cosplay
      venture by thanking our organizers and coordinators who made this leg
      possible!! I sent out the following letter as shown below:

    <h2>conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      I somehow actually made it through this blog cuz it&#39;s been a while since I
      documented something in detail!! however, there&#39;s some topics that
      aren&#39;t included in this one, but I&#39;ll let the pictures do the
      talking!!

      I initially wanted to postpone cosplaying for the whole of July to focus on
      <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://youtube.com/@SenriMana">Senri Mana</a>,
      but this gave me more reasons to cosplay who I love!! come August, I&#39;ll
      have a special treat for our fellow Batae√±os, so keep on the lookout on the
      blog for details~
